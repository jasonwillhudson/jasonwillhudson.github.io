            <h3>Project Iteration</h3>
            <strong>Iteration 1</strong>
            <p style="padding: 3px;">
                This iteration got a lot of the initial ground work done, but a lot of time was spent in planning and
                the initial infrastructure. There were a couple big items done such as the Signup system as we could not
                proceed without having this completed. There was a good mix of medium to large sized components
                completed for this iteration (2 and 4 point features). The velocity of the first iteration is pretty
                good as we start it a little bit late and get 8 points done in about a week.

            </p>
            <strong>Iteration 2</strong>
            <p style="padding: 3px;">
                This iteration actually had relatively few big features completed. A lot of time was spent
                investigating, designing/redesigning work for the larger features for iteration 3. Most of the points
                came from doing the smaller features such as displaying data and the only big feature was Delete user.
                There were mostly small components worth 1 point done in this iteration with one feature worth 4. The
                velocity of this iteration is slower than iteration 1 (8 points in one week compared to 9 points in two
                weeks) as we intend to focus on setting up backend functions for each of the features.
            </p>
            <strong>Iteration 3</strong>
            <p style="padding: 3px;">
                Iteration 3 really got a lot of features done as most of the big features were completed. There was one
                1 point, one 2 point, and three 4 point features completed for this iteration. The velocity of this
                iteration is much faster as the functions for each of the features are mostly set in iteration 2 that we
                had spent time on. Unfortunately we also had to abandon some planned features as there was not enough
                time for the deadline. Should we have an iteration 4, the abandoned issues would be the next goal.
