        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>
          Splittr is a cost-splitting app that allows groups of users an easy
          way to record and split costs between members of the group. Users can
          sign up/login to access their accounts. Users
          then can create bills to send to each other with the option to pay
          within the app through Stripe. App features include creating,
          billing, and payments with a searchable history log.
        </p>

        <h4>Project Iteration</h4>
        <strong>Iteration 1</strong>
        <p>
          This iteration got a lot of the initial ground work done, but a lot of
          time was spent in planning and the initial infrastructure. There were
          a couple big items done such as the Signup system as we could not
          proceed without having this completed. There was a good mix of medium
          to large sized components completed for this iteration (2 and 4 point
          features). The velocity of the first iteration is pretty good as we
          start it a little bit late and get 8 points done in about a week.
        </p>
        <br />
        <strong>Iteration 2</strong>
        <p>
          This iteration actually had relatively few big features completed. A
          lot of time was spent investigating, designing/redesigning work for
          the larger features for iteration 3. Most of the points came from
          doing the smaller features such as displaying data and the only big
          feature was Delete user. There were mostly small components worth 1
          point done in this iteration with one feature worth 4. The velocity of
          this iteration is slower than iteration 1 (8 points in one week
          compared to 9 points in two weeks) as we intend to focus on setting up
          backend functions for each of the features.
        </p>
        <br />
        <strong>Iteration 3</strong>
        <p>
          Iteration 3 really got a lot of features done as most of the big
          features were completed. There was one 1 point, one 2 point, and three
          4 point features completed for this iteration. The velocity of this
          iteration is much faster as the functions for each of the features are
          mostly set in iteration 2 that we had spent time on. Unfortunately we
          also had to abandon some planned features as there was not enough time
          for the deadline. Should we have an iteration 4, the abandoned issues
          would be the next goal.
