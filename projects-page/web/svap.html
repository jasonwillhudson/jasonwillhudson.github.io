        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>
          Svap is a website based in the Greater Vancouver area for people to
          trade items with others. Users are allowed to post the item they want
          to trade and show others what kind of item they want to trade with.
          Users can also browse through the posts on the site to find the item
          they might be interested in trading with. Our website also has a
          built-in chat that allows users to contact the traders by asking
          questions and or arranging a meet up for trading.
