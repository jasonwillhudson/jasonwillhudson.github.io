        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>
          This project is done in a two-person team using software tools Bracket
          and GitHub with HTML and CSS as programming Languages. The project is
          from the class IAT 339 which is a course about the approaches for
          technical aspects such as content management, responsive design, and
          server-side support. In this project, we are asked to design and
          develop a website for an online store. The final website must be
          responsive with good usability for users.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          My main role in this project is programing (web development). Before
          the programming begin, I discussed the layout with color and
          typography choices with my teammates. To let users find the
          information they need on the website easily, I decide to make the
          layout as simple as possible to display the information clearly on the
          page. For a page with less information, I split the page in half which
          gives the user a clear view of different areas. For the page with more
          information, I split the page into three different sections for
          different information, and it makes the information organized on the
          page.
        </p>

        <br />
        <br />

        <h4>Programming</h4>

        <p>
          Since the layout of our website is either vertical aligned or
          horizontal aligned, we decide to use flexbox for developing our
          responsive website. I began with a container that has the display
          property set to flex. For the pages split in half, I added two columns
          and set their flex-basis to 50%. For the pages that have three
          sections, I set their flex-basis to 33.3%. In the end, to make the
          website responsive to the smaller size of the screen, I used media
          queries to stack the columns together.
        </p>

        <div class="split-wrap">
          <img src="../../image/project/project-1/lips_f1.JPG" alt="image 4" />
          <img src="../../image/project/project-1/lips_f2.JPG" alt="image 4" />
        </div>

        <br />
        <br />

        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>
          As an online shopper myself, the things that annoyed me the most of
          the time are the complex contents and squeezed texts. In this project,
          our simple layout design provides more space between different
          elements and minimum decoration gives a clean look which helps users
          to find the important information easier and faster.
