                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>This project is done in a two-person team using software tools Bracket and GitHub with HTML and
                        CSS as programming Languages. The project is from the class IAT 339 which is a course about the
                        approaches for technical aspects such as content management, responsive design, and server-side
                        support. In this project, we are asked to design and develop a website for an online store. The
                        final website must be responsive with good usability for users. (Click the Image to See Website)

                    <h3>Design/Planning</h3>
                    <p>My main role in this project is programing (web development). Before the programming begin, I
                        discussed the layout and page contents with my teammates. To let users find the information they
                        need on the website easily, I decide to make the layout as simple as possible to display the
                        information clearly on the page. For a page with less information, I split the page in half
                        which gives the user a clear view of different areas. For the page with more information, I
                        split the page into three different sections for different information, and it makes the
                        information organized on the page. </p>

                    <h3>Programming</h3>

                    <p>Since the layout of our website is either vertical aligned or horizontal aligned, we decide to
                        use flexbox for developing our responsive website. I began with a container that has the display
                        property set to flex. For the pages split in half, I added two columns and set their flex-basis
                        to 50%. For the pages that have three sections, I set their flex-basis to 33.3%. In the end, to
                        make the website responsive to the smaller size of the screen, I used media queries to stack the
                        columns together.</p>

                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                    <p>As an online shopper myself, the things that annoyed me the most of the time are the complex
                        contents and squeezed texts. In this project, our simple layout design provides more space
                        between different elements and minimum decoration gives a clean look which helps users to find
                        the important information easier and faster. </p>
