            <h3>Narrative</h3>
            <p>The player is the new trainee of the local newspaper as a war reporter. The local newspaper
                office plans to open a new section aimed to collect war-related stories to promote the anti-war
                movement. After weeks of researching, the result was not satisfactory. The supervisor, Mr.
                Robinson, urges the player to submit the work as soon as possible as the training is competitive
                and little time left. This is the last chance for the player to collect photos and explore.
                After the player understands their mission, the player arrives on the after-war battlefield. A dog
                comes in front of the player, guiding the player to follow its feet to find his owner. While the
                player follows along with it and looks around, the player obtains narrative clues searching from
                different buildings to reveal a sorrowful story about Charles Dickens and his family.</p>
