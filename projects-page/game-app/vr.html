        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>
          The player is the new trainee of the local newspaper as a war
          reporter. The local newspaper office plans to open a new section aimed
          to collect war-related stories to promote the anti-war movement. After
          weeks of researching, the result was not satisfactory. The supervisor,
          Mr. Robinson, urges the player to submit the work as soon as possible
          as the training is competitive and little time left. This is the last
          chance for the player to collect photos and explore. After the player
          understands their mission, the player arrives on the after-war
          battlefield. A dog comes in front of the player, guiding the player to
          follow its feet to find his owner. While the player follows along with
          it and looks around, the player obtains narrative clues searching from
          different buildings to reveal a sorrowful story about Charles Dickens
          and his family.
