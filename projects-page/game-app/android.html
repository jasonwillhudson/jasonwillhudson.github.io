        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>
          The Beauty Diary is an app for users to write their beauty journeys
          such as losing weight, skincare and notes for the makeup. This app
          allows users to post their beauty journeys as moments, so that users
          can browse through the posts they posted to see the change and
          improvement from the past. Users can also search the posts with
          keywords to review the posts from the past and delete the ones that
          the user does not want to see again. In addition, the username and
          password help to make the journey private and safe.
