                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>This project is done in 2 people team using software tools Bracket and GitHub with HTML and CSS as programming Language. THe project is from the class IAT 339 which is a course about the approaches for technical aspects such
                        as content management, responsive design, and server-side support. In this project, we are asked
                        to design and develop a website for an online store. The final website must be responsive with
                        good usability for users.(Click the Image to See Website)</p>

                    <h3>Design/Planning</h3>
                    <p>My main role in this project is programing (web development). Before the programming begin, I
                        discussed the layout and page contents with my teammates. To let users find the information they
                        need on the website easily, I decide to make the layout as simple as possible in order to
                        display the information clearly on the page. For page with less information, I split the page in
                        half which gives user a clean view on different area. For the page with more
                        information, I split the page into three different section for different information, and it
                        makes the information organized on the page. </p>

                    <h3>Programming</h3>

                    <p>Since the layout of our website is either vertical aligned or horizontal aligned, we decide to
                        use
                        flexbox for developing our responsive website. I began with a container which has the display
                        property set to flex. For the pages split in half, I added two columns and set their flex basis
                        to
                        50%. For the pages has three sections, I set their flex basis to 33.3%. In the end, to make the
                        website responsive, I used media queries to stack the columns together when the website is
                        browsed
                        on a smaller size screen.</p>

                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                    <p>As an online shopper myself, the things annoyed me the most of time are the complex contents and
                        squeezed texts. In this project, our simple layout design provides more space between different
                        elements and minimum decoration gives a clean look which helps users to find the important
                        information easier and faster. </p>
