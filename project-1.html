                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>This project is done in IAT 339 which is a course about the approaches for technical aspects such
                        as content management, responsive design, and server-side support. In this project, we are asked
                        to design and develop a website for an online store. The final website must be responsive with
                        good usability for users.(Click the Image to See Website)</p>

                <h3>Before Programming</h3>
                <p>My main role in this project is programing (web development). Before the programming begin, I
                    discussed the layout and page contents with my teammates. We decide to make the layout of the pages
                    in either split in half or three equal sections. </p>
            </div>

                <h3>Programming</h3>

                <p>Since the layout of our website is either vertical aligned or horizontal aligned, we decide to use
                    flexbox for developing our responsive website. I began with a container which has the display
                    property set to flex. For the pages split in half, I added two columns and set their flex basis to
                    50%. For the pages has three sections, I set their flex basis to 33.3%. In the end, to make the
                    website responsive, I used media queries to stack the columns together when the website is browsed
                    on a smaller size screen.</p>

                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>As an online shopper myself, the things annoyed me the most of time are the complex contents and
                    squeezed texts. In this project, our simple layout design provides more space between different
                    elements and minimum decoration gives a clean look which helps users to find the important
                    information easier and faster. </p>
