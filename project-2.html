                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>This is a project from IAT 235 which is a course focuses on visual information design and
                        fundamental knowledges of HTML and CSS. In this project, we are asked to choose an educational
                        topic and make a website for it. The result should represent the information using icons or
                        diagrams instead of text as much as possible.(Click the Image to See Website)</p>

                    <h3>Before Programming</h3>
                    <p>My main role in this project is icon design and programming(web developement). We chose to make a
                        website to raise the attention from parents and educate them how to prevent their kids from
                        suicide.
                        Since the three key words for this topic are “Death”, “Warnings” and “Danger”, we decided to use
                        red
                        and black as primary colors, blue and yellow for contrast. Before the programming start, I
                        designed
                        the icons for the button refer to the content and data. </p>

                    <h3>Programming</h3>

                    <p>This is the first programming class I took, so I did not have much knowledge on responsive
                        design. I
                        chose to use grid to arrange the text and images on the website since it is the only way I
                        learned
                        from the class. Without the knowledge of responsive design and to ensure the layout looks the
                        same
                        on mobile devices, I chose to use vw and vh as unit for the size of items such as font size and
                        image width, which will keep the layout by shrinking or expanding depending on the width of the
                        device.</p>

                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                    <p>From this project, I learned how to effectively convey the information and data by using the
                        combination of image, icon, diagram and text. Most importantly, it gives me a full experience on
                        building a website using the basic programming knowledges, which helps me to become more success
                        in
                        the future web development class.</p>
